# Note: if you change the phy_init or app partition offset, make sure to change the offset in Kconfig.projbuild
# Depending on what data is included in the coredump, the size of the coredump partition might also need to be increased to a larger size, like 512K. The memfault_coredump_storage_compute_size_required() function in the Memfault SDK can be used to compute the maximum coredump size, which can vary depending on user configuration.
